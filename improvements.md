# Project Improvements and Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the work done to make the repository installable, configurable, and runnable end‑to‑end. It includes dependency fixes, code changes, newly implemented features, configuration issues, and how to run and verify the program.

## Overview
- Tools and Technologies Used:
  - Embeddings: Hugging Face multilingual-e5-large
  - Text generation: Google Gemini (gemini-pro family)
  - Vector DB: Pinecone
  - Graph DB: Neo4j
  - UI: Gradio
- Ensured clean startup/shutdown flows, added logging for easy debugging, and introduced caching and async neo4j queries to improve responsiveness.

## Dependency and Environment Fixes
- Created a fresh Python environment and installed packages from `requirements.txt`.
- Aligned Pinecone client version with current API expectations to avoid incompatibilities (see changes in `pinecone_upload.py`).
- Resolved visualization library usage errors by removing unsupported parameters passed to `network`/`vis` show methods.
- Standardized config access via `config.py` and environment variables.

## Configuration
Populate `config.py` with your credentials and settings. Typical fields include:
- Google Gemini API key
- Hugging Face token (if required for model access)
- Pinecone API key, environment/region, and index name
- Neo4j URI, username, password, and database name

Security tip: Do not commit real credentials. Use environment variables or a local untracked override.

## Code Changes by File
- `load_to_neo4j.py`
  - Ensured Neo4j driver session and driver are closed properly to prevent resource leaks.

- `visualize_graph.py`
  - Fixed call to the visualization library by removing an unsupported argument to the `show()` function and aligning with the installed `vis-network` usage.

- `pinecone_upload.py`
  - Updated to a compatible Pinecone client version and API signatures.

- `hybrid_chat.py`
  - Updated LLM calls to use Google Gemini (gemini-pro) client and request/response shapes.
  - Implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline using Pinecone for candidate retrieval and Neo4j for knowledge expansion.
  - Added conversational memory, embedding cache, async parallel fetches to Neo4j, and structured logging. (Additional features)

- `gradio_app.py`
  - Built a clean Gradio interface around the chat pipeline with session memory and streaming-style updates.

- `config.py`
  - Modified API Keys and Database credentials.

## New Features Implemented
1) Conversational memory
   - Maintains short-term context of the last user query/prompt and its response.
2) Clean local UI (Gradio)
   - Local web app for chatting, inspecting responses, and quick testing.
3) Embedding cache
   - Caches vectorizations of repeated prompts to reduce repititive querying and generating embeddings
4) Async parallel Neo4j lookups
   - After Pinecone retrieval, queries Neo4j in parallel for N top nodes to enrich context.
5) Extensive logging
   - Logs inputs, Pinecone results, Neo4j results, prompts, and model outputs (`logging/logs.txt`). Useful for debugging.

## Setup and Run
Below are typical steps; adapt to your environment as needed.

1) Python environment
- Create/activate a virtual environment (or use the provided `task_venv/`).
- Install dependencies:
  - From `requirements.txt`.

2) Configure credentials
- Update `config.py` with your Gemini, Pinecone, and Neo4j details.

3) Load data to Neo4j 
- Run `load_to_neo4j.py` to ingest entities/relations from the dataset (`vietnam_travel_dataset.json`).

4) Build/refresh Pinecone index
- Run `pinecone_upload.py` to create/populate the index as configured in `config.py`.

5) Start the UI
- Run `gradio_app.py` to launch the web UI. The app will print the local URL.
